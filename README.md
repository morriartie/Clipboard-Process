# Clipboard Process

This script copies the text on the clipboard process it and replaces on clipboard
With auto replace enabled, you type the text followed by the command anywhere in your system and it will be replaced by its output.

The process is defined by a "command" which should be written in the text after a defined separator (default: ##)

Add this script to a shortcut in your system. Type the 'text ##command' and press the shortcut
